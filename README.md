## Common Errors You May Encounter
### Error: ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED
This error indicates that your application uses an algorithm or key size not supported by OpenSSL 3.0.
#### Solution: 
1. If you use *Windows*, in the `package.json` file, set the "scripts" attributes as follows:

```
  "scripts": {
  "start": "SET NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider && react-scripts start", 
  "build": "SET NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider && react-scripts build", 
  ...
    },
```

2. If you use *Mac OSX or Linux*, include the following command in the `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` file.

```
  export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```
